## Reliable and Interpretable Artificial Intelligence (2020) Lecture 1

### Building Reliable AI system is Hard

**Example 1:**

By adding a little bit noise, AI cannot recognize the picture correctly while humans unlikely to make these mistake.

**Example 2:**

Attacker add some black and white blocks into the picture, then AI cannot recognize this correctly while humans can. This will cause dangers.

**My own thoughts:**

Attackers can add some undetectable noise or some small and certain fuzzy or some interferences to cheat AI to make mistakes even humans cannot make these mistakes at all.

### Three waves of AI

+ **First wave:** Did not consider the noise and uncertainties that will make the system mess.
+ **Second wave:** Deal with uncertainty but it is hard to explain their decisions and hart to ensure reliability and safety.
+ **Third wave:** Deal with uncertainty and also ready to explain the issues in second wave.
